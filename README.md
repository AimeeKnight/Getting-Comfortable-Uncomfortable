### Title
Getting Comfortable Being Uncomfortable - Lessons Learned One Year After the Nashville Software School

### Description
There's no denying that engineers are in high demand. Bootcamps are popping up everywhere, and while they're churning out highly motivated juniors, often it's seniors that companies are really after. So how do we bridge this gap together? On the surface it often looks like we've 'naturally' developed into our current roles. And, as we progress it's incredibly easy to forget what it was like being new. Rest assured however, for most the journey has been filled with a whole lot of grit, determination, and discipline.

In this talk, we'll discuss lessons learned one year after going from a bootcamp grad, to a full time, full stack JavaScript developer. Plan to walk away empowered, and with renewed passion for the incredible industry we're all a part of!

### Notes
Over the past two and a half years I've gone from teaching myself the basics, to becoming a full stack JavaScript developer, helping build out an email platform for companies like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. My passion and energy has been recognized by people outside of work, opening up opportunities for me to become a panelist on the JavaScript Jabber, and Angular Air podcasts. I'm incredibly blessed, but also work extremely hard, and I'm passionate about sharing the steps I've taken in hopes of empowering others.
