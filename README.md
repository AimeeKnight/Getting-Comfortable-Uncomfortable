### Title
Getting Comfortable Being Uncomfortable - Lessons Learned One Year After the Nashville Software School

### Description
There’s no denying that engineers are in high demand. Boot camps are popping up everywhere, and while they’re churning out highly motivated juniors, often it’s seniors that companies are really after. So how do we bridge this gap together? Over the past three years, I’ve gone from a former professional figure skater teaching myself basic HTML, to a full stack JavaScript developer, helping build out platforms for companies like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Warner Brothers. During that time I learned valuable lessons that helped me navigate my way through my first years as a developer, and I watched as my team grew right along with me. Working with a diverse team was full of wildly uncomfortable challenges for all of us.

In this talk, we’ll discuss lessons learned one year after going from a boot camp graduate to a full-time JavaScript developer. Not only will I cover advice for newer developers, but I’ll also discuss what you can do if you’re a more advanced developer who works with newer developers. We’ll walk through effective techniques for mentoring, interviewing, and learning new technologies while striking a sustainable balance.

### Notes
Over the past three years, I’ve gone from teaching myself the basics to becoming a full stack JavaScript developer, helping build out applications for companies like Warner Bros Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. My passion and energy have been recognized by people outside of work, opening up opportunities for me to become a panelist on the JavaScript Jabber, and Angular Air podcasts. I’m incredibly blessed but also work extremely hard, and I’m passionate about sharing the steps I’ve taken in hopes of empowering others.
