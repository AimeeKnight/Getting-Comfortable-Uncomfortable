						Name, Work for... heard me on...
						<br>
						Also pretty new...
						<br>
						Before becoming a dev, spent 15 years skating...
						<br>
						Come to realize over the past few years as I've worked to enter this field
						<br>
						Becoming a developer feels a lot like becoming a successful skater.
						<br>
						With that said, I'd like to show something...
						<hr>
						Now, I want to do a quick exercise;
						<br>
						Hands above head, 1 turn. (Confident!)
						<br>
						Bet you guys feel uncomfortable... That's what it's like to be a Jr learning!
						<br>
						I’m comfortable here...
						only because I’ve learned to get comfortable with this feeling! :)
						<br>
						Over and over again I talk to juniors and we always have the same conversation.
						<br>
						I’m not going to say you have to do this... or that... today
						I don't believe in those kind of absolutes...
						<br>
						But I am... going to share what’s worked for me... common things I keep hearing.

						<aside class="notes">
							So, how do we effectively funnel incoming devs to address this?
							<br>
							That's one problem boot camps are good at addressing!
							<br>
							They're popping up everywhere, churning out highly motivated Jr's,
							but let's be honest, companies are usually looking for seniors.
							<br>
							In order to bridge the gap together, going to talk about what it actually looks like
							to go from a bootcamp,
							to full time developer, and what senior devs can do to support the process.
							<br>
							We all like to talk about numbers.
							I challenge you, to look at the solution,
							and acknowledge what the process actually looks like.

						<h1>My Story</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							After skating => College
							<br>
							Ended up in marketing
							- Intrigued by CMS
							- Starting to experiment a little :)
							<br>
							Treehouse - Basics - Wordpress
							<br>
							PHP => Should do Rails... 4 hours to Rails Bridge, Rails Girls
							<br>
							Got more serious... decided on 2nd Bachelors in IT.... too slow... no Rails!
							<br>
							Bootcamp research =>
							3 DAYS to another only to turn around & come home => (airbnb & flat tire along the way)
							<br>
							All in!!! Wanted something longer and harder => NSS

					<h1>JavaScript</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						Pretty soon after that decision, I did start to miss Rails and synchronous flow!
						<br>
						Past DOM manipulation JS typically isn't the most beginner friendly.
						<br>
						Wrking butt off though, and started to notice things...
						<br>
						Two of my mentors were saying really nice things about me on Hacker News.
						<br>
						Then was interviewed on some podcast's.
						<br>
						I was asked to help with some large conferences and a Meetup.
						<br>
						And got a raise!
						<br>
						All feeling totally out of my element.
						<br>
						Contrary to how uncomfortable I was... I was doing something right!

						<h2>Employers probably aren’t hiring you expecting you to solve their most complex problems. Sorry! :(</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							Let's first dispel the elephant in the room, and start with breaking in.
							<br>
							Employers probably aren’t hiring you expecting you to solve their most complex problems.
							<br>
							On the other end of the spectrum, don’t hold back from applying for jobs because you don’t feel ready.
							Let your future employer decide this!
							<br>
							(FADE IN) Making 'some' mistakes is expected & normal.

							You also don't want to be this guy
							<br>
							Contrary to what pop culture says, you should be

							<br>
							Establish a presence in the community.

							Jr's have flooded the market... need got to speak up & stand out!

						<h2>Hard work beats talent!</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Be passionate. Literally everywhere, and with every one you meet.
							<br>
							The industry is filled with people who've been writing code, and studying CS since they were kids.
							<br>
							It's also filled with passionate people who enjoy it as a hobby.
							<br>
							When you're entering the field, you've got a lot to prove,
							& people will be making a bet on you.
							<br>
							The more excited you are, the easier the decision will be.
							<br>
							Can also look for ways to contribute on GitHub.
							Doesn't matter what.
							<br>
							A lot of juniors have said, this how they broke in!
							<br>
							Asked to work on first prod Rails app after submitting a doc PR
							to the Rails Bridge Curriculum.
							<br>
							You're degree doesn't really mean anything if you don't have the work ethic and passion to put it into practice.
							<br>
							Dave Thomas who wrote the "Pragmatic Programmer" even talked about
							the power of a passionate dev on a recent podcast essentially saying
							<br>
							those who weren't should even be in the field in his opinion.

						<h2>All jobs are not created equal!</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Next, all jobs are not created equal!
							<br>
							You may need to strike a balance between your dream job,
							and ok for now, because ‘a job’ is better than sitting at home doing tutorials forever.
							<br>
							Sure perks & high salary are nice, but if you want to grow & sustain your career,
							mentorship, testing, coding standards, and code reviews should all be at the top of your list.

						<h1>Hard work with practical approaches</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							Bootcamps are a great way to jump start you're learning,
							but they're not meant to take you 100% of the way.

							Some things you can only learn on the job.

						<h1>Hard work with practical approaches</h1>
						<h3>Getting up to speed</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							1st: Start with test - Read them AND write them
							<br>
							Reading them is best way to get up to speed on a large code base.
							<br>
							Writing your own makes you look professional and like you care.
							<br>
							2nd strategy: break stuff
							<br>
							Figure out what went wrong & how to fix it. Makes thing stick.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Hard work with practical approaches</h1>
						<h3>The Boy Scout Rule</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							Work to always leave the code better than you found it.
							<br>
							There are tons of things that go on day to day outside of
							just writing code.
							<br>
							Regardless, you should always focus on writing maintainable code.
							<br>
							That means the code you write is readable, extensible, & testable.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Moving past tutorials</h2>
						<img src="img/real_world.jpg">
						<aside class="notes">
							In order to grow, you also need to start looking past tutorials.
							<br>
							Instead, check out source code for the libraries you use on GitHub.
							<br>
							Read RFC's as well.
							<br>
							Easier to understand than you think,
							and usually the most accurate documentation.

							Next up, let's talk about working smart.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="img/code_once.jpg">
						<aside class="notes">
							Everyone knows the saying, ‘Failing to plan is planning to fail’.
							<br>
							Spend time thinking before coding. Ex: API => start with Docs.
							<br>
							Have an opinion... be able to explain why you made the choices you made!
							Nothing is more painful than seeing code that's been C&P'd and you know it.
							<br>
							Understand every line of code you write.
							If it’s there, it should have a purpose.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Practice makes permanent</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							With my background in skating and coaching, I know first hand
							that practice does NOT make perfect... it makes permanent.
							<br>
							Focus less on being a great developer, more on being great problem solver.
							<br>
							With that said, you should be reflecting on your work regularly.
							<br>
							When you're working on a tough problem, and you finally come up with a solution,
							step back, and retrace your steps.
							<br>
							Write things down even.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>One thing at a time</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							Pick one thing and stick with it - ES6, Angular.
							<br>
							I knew I wanted to do full stack JS,
							but also knew I wasn't going to learn 1/2 dozen API's & Web UI at once.
							<br>
							Also, don't be overwhelmed by the # of libraries & frameworks.
							<br>
							Pick one thing, with an overall focus on problem solving.
							<br>
							Languages, libraries, and frameworks are just tools. They come and go.
							What's popular today probably won’t be popular a decade from now.
							<br>
							Be lifelong learner.

						<h1>Mental Awareness</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							Take care of yourself mentally and physically.
							I’ve been determined to stay in shape, & balanced.
							<br>
							Up at 6 => gym => run => work
							Sneak in podcasts sometimes. (Sshhh!)
							Only when up for it.
							<br>
							Finish the day => meditation
							<br>
							Stay grounded & focused.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Stop calling yourself dumb!</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							Stop calling yourself dumb! => Self fulfilling prophecy.
							<br>
							Self talk = time to ‘fake it till you make it’!
							<br>
							Much as want job only about writing code, not reality.
							<br>
							Can be emotional career.
							Whether we (yes even guys) want to admit it or not,
							going to be highs and lows.
							<br>
							Also be aware of The Dunning-Kruger effect.
							<br>
							Says there's tendency for under performers to OVER estimate abilities
							<br>
							& high performers to UNDER estimate their abilities.

						<h2>Bootcamps vs Going at it alone</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							A lot of people ask my opinion on whether they should do bootcamp or learn on own.

							<br>
							So much so, I've tried to keep the theme going. (FADE IN)

						<aside class="notes">
							Now on mentoring and working with seniors
							<br>
							(FADE IN) Sun Microsystems studied the progress of
							1,000 employees over a 5-year period and determined devs who had mentors got promoted 5x
							more than those that didn't
							<br>
							Ask if you can pair at work. As a Jr still learning to create a mental model...
							Paring allows you to step back and form an overall picture of the problem.
							<br>
							Also get mentorship from code reviews, contributing to open source.
							<br>
							If nothing else stand back & soak up what you see Sr's do.
							Ask if you can stay late & peek over shoulder.

							You can either go to the shelter and find an old one, or... you can get a puppy!
							<br>
							Older dogs are usually already house trained, but they also have bad habits.
							<br>
							Puppies are notorious for chewing/making a mess, but given a nice environment & training
							the investment can be rewarding.
							<br>
							If getting a puppy sound fun, make sure you’re committed to the process, or they’ll end up in the shelter!

						<h1>Preparing yourself and the team</h1>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">Establishing a culture of communication</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							(FADE IN) If you don't already have one, establish a culture of open communication.
							<br>
							Everyone should be sharing knowledge no matter what their job title is.
							<br>
							A lot of people entering the field are coming from another career.
							Their insight can offer new perspectives.
							<br>
							It builds trust & an environment where disagreements are healthy &
							highly constructive.
							<br>
							If your team has Jr's, make sure you're checking in often & asking lots of questions...
							<br>
							Some newbies find it intimidating to speak up.
							You may need to watch for non-verbal queues.
							Ask directly, “Does this make sense”?

						<h1>Preparing yourself and the team</h1>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">Frame conversations accordingly</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							One big thing I've noticed over the past few years is how easy it is to forget
							what you actually know.
							<br>
							(FADE IN) You'll help Jr's on your team immensely, if you frame conversations accordingly.
							<br>
							Which means explain things differently to a Jr than you would a Sr.
							<br>
							A lot of the time Jr's don’t have the same context to rely on.
							<br>
							If you and I were watching the Olympics together and I told you 'a skater cheated their
							double axel & had a wrap’, you’d have no idea.
							<br>
							Instead, I could say to you 'they rotated their foot a 1/4 turn
							before taking off (cheating),
							<br>
							and their leg went above their knee in the air
							(wrapping) which is poor style’.
							<br>
							I might even get up and draw… hint!
							<br>
							With the inverse approach:
							<br>
							You might not know what a double axel is, so you Google that,
							<br>
							then you have to figure out what the heck
							‘cheated’ and ‘wrap’ mean.. in that context.
							<br>
							Before you know it, what could be explained quickly,
							turned into a 30 minute rabbit hole for you.
							<br>
							You might think this is a pain, but it'll help you grow as you’ll
							have to think about problems in a different way.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Preparing yourself and the team</h1>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">Good project management</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							(FADE IN) Project mgmt. is another subtle, but extremely crucial step.
							<br>
							Managers & product managers should work together
							to ensure projects flow smoothly.
							<br>
							Jr's are still getting used to being able to gauge timing on projects,
							and will probably need time before they're able to give solid estimates.
							<br>
							Ambiguity can be tough to deal with too.
							So, you need to set explicit expectations.
							<br>
							Provide additional details or constraints & break tasks down.
							Doing so will ultimately help a new developer contribute faster.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="img/duck.gif" style="width: 60%">
						<aside class="notes">
							I've also seen the inverse, where Jr's aren't given enough to do.
							<br>
							It's easy to resort to having a Jr's sit idle, or to never be delegated substantial tasks.
							<br>
							It all goes back to planning & making an informed, strategic decision hiring.

						<aside class="notes">
							Let's talk about preparing your code base, (FADE IN) specifically with testing.

							(FADE IN) Microsoft did a study and found the number of defects decreased 40-90% when they started doing TDD.

							(FADE IN) And they initial development time only increased 5-35%

							Increases confidence making changes for everyone.

							but with a Jr on your team, it means you'll have less to worry about in your code review.
							<br>
							(FADE IN) A really important part of this is comments.
							<br>
							Saying goes, those who don’t think they need comments, are usually the worst offenders!
							<br>
							Developing a team style guide is also great project for a Jr because it will ensure
							they understand best practices.
							<br>
							(FADE IN) JSCS makes this easier and helps with docs.
							<br>
							Without a doubt teams should be linting as well.

						<aside class="notes">
							Don’t just tell a Jr what to do.
							Ask them their thoughts on doing something in the way you propose.
							<br>
							It forces them to think, and come up with own thoughts.
							<br>
							After, tell them ‘why’.

							#1 Thing:
							Tell the Jr when you’re not sure.
							Seriously... please!
							<br>
							sets an example for humility, and NOT doing so will eventually come back to bite the team.
							<br>
							Don’t get too clever with your solutions.
							<br>
							If it was hard to write, it’ll be even harder to read in the future!
							<br>
							Debug pair programming can be immensely valuable
							<br>
							Whether people admit or not, everyone writes bugs.
							<br>
							More often than not, we're working on existing code bases.
							<br>
							Learning strategies to quickly pin point issues in code you didn't write is
							arguably more difficult than writing your own program from scratch.
							<br>
							With that said, next time you’re debugging grab the Jr on your team
							and walk through the process with them.

							They'll also help you understand how people perceive you better.
							<br>
							Mentee reveal ALL the good and bad traits you possess.
							<br>
							There’s a very strong mentorship model in this industry.
							<br>
							Pay back into it by taking an active, rather than passive role in the progress of the Jr's
							on your team.
							(Less Tweeting… more doing!)
							<br>
							Of course teaching is a skill.. not something everyone enjoys.
							<br>
							Strive to contribute in whatever way you can.
