						Ice breaker - hands above head, 1 turn. Bold, confident! That's what it's like to be Jr!
						<br>
						First off let me start off saying I’m actually comfortable up here... but only because I’ve learned to get comfortable with this feeling!
						<br>
						Over and over again I talk to juniors and we always have the same conversation.
						<br>
						I’m not to tell you that you have to do it this way, or that way...
						I can’t stand when people do that!
						<br>
						Instead, I’m going to share what’s worked for me, and the common things I keep hearing about talking to others entering the field.

						<h2>How do we effectively funnel incoming developers to address this problem? </h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							That's the problem boot camps are so good at addressing!
							<br>
							They're popping up everywhere, churning out highly motivated juniors,
							but let's be honest, compaines are usually looking for seniors.
							<br>
							In order to bridge this gap together, we'll audit what it actually looks like to go from bootcamp grad,
							to full time developer, and what senior developers need to do in order to support this process.
							<br>
							We all like to talk about numbers.
							I challenge you now, to talk about a solution,
							and acknowledge what this process will actually look like.

						<aside class="notes">
							* Let's first dispel the elephant in the room and start with breaking in.
							<br>
							On the other end of the spectrum, don’t hold back from applying for jobs because you don’t feel ready.
							Let your future employer decide this!

						<h2>Hard work beats talent</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Be confident and show how passionate you are. Literally every chance you get.
							<br>
							Look for ways to contribute on GitHub.
							Doesn’t matter what.
							Believe it or not, this will likely lead to jobs.
							I was asked to work on my first productions Rails app as a result of submitting a documentation PR
							to the Rails Bridge Curriculum.
							<br>
							You're degree doesn't really mean anything if you don't have the work ethic and passion to put it into practice.
							<br>
							Dave Thomas who wrote the "Pragmatic Programmer" even talked about this on a recent podcast.

						<h2>All jobs are not created equal!</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							You may need to strike a balance between your dream job,

						<h1>Hard work with practical approaches</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							The industry is filled with people who have been writing code, and studying computer science since they were kids.
							If overtime doesn’t sounds like a sacrifice you’re willing to make, then this may not be the career for you.
							<br>
							What does hard work look like?
							<br>
							Ex: Driving four hours to attend a Rails Bridge workshop, then another four hours to attend Rails Girls
							when you're trying to learn.
							Ex: Driving three days to another bootcamp only to turn around and come home because you didn’t think it would be hard enough.
							<br>
							I may or may not have done those things.
							<br>
							People who are good at this enjoy it as a hobby too.
							<br>
							If you’re really, really new, make sure this is something you truly want to do.
							<br>
							It is definitely a ton of fun, but it can also be all consuming and stressful.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="img/the-matrix-bullet-time-gif.gif">
						<aside class="notes">
							You’re going to be doing less of this...
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="img/tree_slam.gif">
						<aside class="notes">
							And more of this...
							<br>
							First strategy is to break stuff.
							<br>
							Then figure out what went wrong and how to fix it.
							This is an excellent way to learn, as it makes thing stick!
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Hard work with practical approaches</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							Refactoring is another strategy: Being a developer isn’t just about writing code. There are a million
							different things that go on day to day during a your job that you'll need to balance.
							<br>
							Can sometime lead to a death march, and before you know it code quality suffers,
							and your number of bugs goes up.
							With that said, don’t ever check in code that isn’t a little better off than before you started.
							Maintainable code is code that is easily readable, extendable, and testable by yourself and the rest of the team.
							<br>
							Write tests - makes you look like a grown up.
						</aside>
					</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Moving past tutorials</h2>
							<img src="img/real_world.jpg">
							<aside class="notes">
								Actually look at the source code for the libraries you use on GitHub.
								<br>
								Read RFC's.
								<br>
								Easier to understand than you think,
								and it’s almost always the most accurate documentation.

						<h1>Working Smart</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="img/code_once.jpg">
						<aside class="notes">
							Everyone knows the saying, ‘Failing to plan is planning to fail’.
							<br>
							Always spend time thinking about the system you’re going to
							implement before writing code. For example, if your creating an API, start with Docs.
							<br>
							Have an opinion... be able to explain why you made the choices you made!
							Nothing is more painful than seeing code that's been C&P'd and you know it because
							it's completely off.
							<br>
							Understand every single line of code you write.
							If it’s there, it needs to have a purpose,
							and you need to be certain it’s doing what you think it’s doing.
							<br>
							Refrain from blindly copying and pasting!
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Practice makes permanent</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							Reflect then repeat.
							<br>
							Don't just strive to be a great developer, strive to be a great problem solver.
							Languages, libraries, and frameworks are just tools. They come and go.
							What's popular today probably won’t be popular a decade from now.
							<br>
							You're going to need to be a lifelong learner.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>One thing at a time</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							Pick one thing and stick with it - ES6, Angular. I knew I wanted to be a full stack
							developer, but I also knew I wasn't going to be able to learn half a dozen 5 API's and
							a Web UI all at once.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Mental Awareness</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							Take care of yourself mentally and physically.
							I’ve been determined to stay in shape, and am trying to remain balanced.
							Always wake up each day, go to the gym, and for a run before work.
							I do sneak in podcasts during that time sometimes. (Sshhh!)
							Only when I’m feeling up for it though.
							<br>
							I’ve learned to go easy on the caffeine.
							Meditation is also extremely valuable in order to stay grounded and focused.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Stop calling yourself dumb!</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							It’s a self fulfilling prophecy.
							Self talk is definitely the time to ‘fake it till you make it’!
							<br>
							As much as you want your job to only be about writing code, that’s not reality.
							<br>
							It can be an emotional career.
							Whether we (yes even guys) want to admit it or not,
							there are going to be highs and lows.
							<br>
							Also be aware of The Dunning-Kruger effect.
							<br>
							Says there's a tendency of under performers to overestimate their abilities
							<br>
							and for high performers to under estimate their abilities.

						<h2>When you don’t know how to do something,
							or you come across a tough bug remind yourself
						</h2>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">Every time something goes wrong in your program,
							you have an opportunity to learn something new!
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							A positive outlook is huge.
                            <br>
							Without it you can enter a pretty vicious cycle
							<br>
							You work your butt off because you feel inadequate
							<br>
							Then you start to feel burned out
							<br>
							And that happens over and over
							<br>
							Establish boundaries to avoid burnout.

						<p>Bootcamps vs Going at it alone</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">Private Slack Channels</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">Junior Focused Hangouts and Meetups</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Started learning alone, and was grateful
							for the opportunity to learn with others instead,
							as part of a bootcamp.
							<br>
							Led me to start a private Slack channel at work for Jr's
							to ask embarrassing questions.
							My manager watching this probably didn’t even know
							about that till I gave this talk!
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="img/jr_study.jpg" style="width:600px;">
						<aside class="notes">
							And also led me to start a Baltimore Junior Developer Meetup which is now a weekly Hangout
							with friends.
							<br>
							There are large org's like Code Newbie with a podcast, twitter chat and Slack group if you
							don't have somehting like this at work or in your area.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Mentoring</h2>>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">Developers who receive mentoring are promoted
							five times more often than those who don’t have mentors.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							* Now on mentoring,
							<br>
							Sun Microsystems studied career progress of
							1,000 employees over a 5-year period and found ^^
							<br>
							Contributing to open source also provides mentorship in the form of code reviews.
							<br>
							You can even just soak in what you see seniors do.
							Ask if you can stay late and just peek over their shoulder.
							<br>
							Paring's also awesome because Jr's are first learning
							how to create mental models.
							<br>
							Pairing can help as it allows time to step back and absorb.

							Puppies are notorious for chewing stuff up and making a mess, but given a nice environment with adequate training the investment can be highly rewarding.

							If getting a puppy sound fun, make sure you’re committed to the process or we’ll just end up in the shelter!

							<br>
							You might need to explain things differently to us than you would a senior developer.
							<br>
							A lot of the time we don’t have the same context to rely on as you do.
							<br>
							If you and I were watching the Olympics together and I told you 'she cheated her
							double axel and had a bad wrap’, you’d have no idea what I meant.
							<br>
							What I could say to you though is; 'she rotated her foot a quarter turn
							before taking off into the air (which is called cheating),
							and her left leg came up above her knee in the air
							(that’s called wrapping) which is really poor style’.
							<br>
							I might even get up and draw what that looks like… hint hint!
							<br>
							With the inverse approach:
							<br>
							You might be fuzzy on what a double axel is, so you go Google that,
							then you follow up by trying to figure out what the heck
							‘cheated’ and ‘wrap’ mean in this context,
							and before you know it what could be explained in one sentence,
							has turned into a 30 minute rabbit hole.
							<br>
							You might think this is a pain, but it will help you grow as you’ll
							have to think about a problem in a very different way.
