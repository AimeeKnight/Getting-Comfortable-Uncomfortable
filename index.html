						Name, Work for... heard me on...
						<br>
						Also pretty new...
						<br>
						Before becoming a dev, spent 15 years skating...
						<br>
						Come to realize over the past few years as I've worked to enter this field
						<br>
						Becoming a developer feels a lot like becoming a successful skater.
						<br>
						With that said, I'd like to show something...
						<hr>
						Now, I want to do a quick exercise;
						<br>
						Hands above head, 1 turn. (Confident!)
						<br>
						Bet you guys feel uncomfortable... That's what it's like to be a Jr learning!
						<br>
						I’m comfortable here...
						only because I’ve learned to get comfortable with this feeling! :)
						<br>
						Over and over again I talk to juniors and we always have the same conversation.
						<br>
						I’m not going to say you have to do this... or that... today
						I don't believe in those kind of absolutes...
						<br>
						But I am... going to share what’s worked for me... common things I keep hearing.

						<aside class="notes">
							So, how do we effectively funnel incoming devs to address this?
							<br>
							That's one problem boot camps are good at addressing!
							<br>
							They're popping up everywhere, churning out highly motivated Jr's,
							but let's be honest, companies are usually looking for seniors.
							<br>
							In order to bridge the gap together, going to talk about what it actually looks like
							to go from a bootcamp,
							to full time developer, and what senior devs can do to support the process.
							<br>
							We all like to talk about numbers.
							I challenge you, to look at the solution,
							and acknowledge what the process actually looks like.

						<aside class="notes">
							After skating => College
							<br>
							Ended up in marketing
							- Intrigued by CMS
							- Starting to experiment a little :)
							<br>
							Treehouse - Basics - Wordpress
							<br>
							PHP => Should do Rails... Rails Bridge, Rails Girls
							<br>
							Got more serious... decided on 2nd Bachelors in IT.... too slow... no Rails! => NSS

					<h1>JavaScript</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						Pretty soon after that decision, I did start to miss Rails and synchronous flow!
						<br>
						Past DOM manipulation JS typically isn't the most beginner friendly.
						<br>
						Wrking butt off though, and started to notice things...
						<br>
						Two of my mentors were saying really nice things about me on Hacker News.
						<br>
						Then was interviewed on some podcast's.
						<br>
						I was asked to help with some large conferences and a Meetup.
						<br>
						And got a raise!
						<br>
						All feeling totally out of my element.
						<br>
						Contrary to how uncomfortable I was... I was doing something right!

						<h2>Nope!</h2>

						<h2>Employers probably aren’t hiring you expecting you to solve their most complex problems. Sorry! :(</h2>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">If you're not making mistakes, then you're not doing anything. I'm positive that a doer makes mistakes. - John Wooden</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Let's first dispel the elephant in the room, and start with breaking in.
							<br>
							Employers probably aren’t hiring you expecting you to solve their most complex problems.
							<br>
							On the other end of the spectrum, don’t hold back from applying for jobs because you don’t feel ready.
							Let your future employer decide this!
							<br>
							(FAD IN) Making 'some' mistakes is expected & normal.

							You also don't want to be this guy
							<br>
							Contrary to what pop culture says, you should be
							Leveraging social media, Hackathons and Meetups.
							<br>
							Establish a presence in the community.
							<br>
							Jr's have flooded the market... need got to speak up & stand out!
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Hard work beats talent!</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Be passionate. Literally everywhere, and with every one you meet.
							<br>
							When you're entering the field, you've got a lot to prove,
							people need to make a bet on you.
							<br>
							The more excited you are, the easier the decision will be.
							<br>
							Can also look for ways to contribute on GitHub.
							Doesn't matter what.
							<br>
							A lot of juniors have said, this how they broke in!
							<br>
							Asked to work on first prod Rails app after submitting a doc PR
							to the Rails Bridge Curriculum.
							<br>
							You're degree doesn't really mean anything if you don't have the work ethic and passion to put it into practice.
							<br>
							Dave Thomas who wrote the "Pragmatic Programmer" even talked about
							the power of a passionate dev on a recent podcast essentially saying
							<br>
							those who weren't should even be in the field in his opinion.

						<h2>All jobs are not created equal!</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Next, all jobs are not created equal!
							<br>
							You may need to strike a balance between your dream job,
							and ok for now, because ‘a job’ is better than sitting at home doing tutorials forever.
							<br>
							Sure perks & high salary are nice, but if you want to grow & sustain your career,
							mentorship, testing, coding standards, and code reviews should all be at the top of your list.

							So, you've got the job... and you see the code base for the first time!

							If you're anything like me, looking at 1/2 dozen apis, 2 etls, and a webui...
							you might feel like this!
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Hard work with practical approaches</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							Bootcamps are a great way to jump start you're learning,
							but they can't take you 100% of the way.
							<br>
							Some things you can only learn on the job.
							<br>
							The industry is filled with people who've been writing code, and studying CS since they were kids.
							<br>
							It's also filled with people who enjoy it as a hobby
							<br>
							If overtime doesn’t sounds like a sacrifice you’re willing to make, might not be for you.
							<br>
							So, what does hard work look like?
							<br>
							Ex: 4 hours to Rails Bridge 4 to Rails Girls
							just to learn Rails in person.
							Ex: Driving 3 days to another bootcamp, => turn around and come home because you want a bigger challenge.
							<br>
							I may or may not have done those things. (With flat tires & questionable airbnb accommodations along the way.)
							<br>
							All that to say, if you’re super new, make sure this is something you really want.
							<br>
							Ton of fun, but time consuming & stressful.

						<h1>Hard work with practical approaches</h1>
						<h3>Getting up to speed...</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							1st: Start with test - Read them AND write them
							<br>
							Reading them is best way to get up to speed on a large code base.
							<br>
							Writing your own makes you look professional and like you care.
							<br>
							2nd strategy: break stuff
							<br>
							Figure out what went wrong & how to fix it. Makes thing stick.

					<section>
						<h1>Hard work with practical approaches</h1>
						<h3>The Boy Scout Rule</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							Work to always leave the code better than you found it.
							<br>
							There are tons of things that go on day to day outside of
							just writing code.
							<br>
							Regardless, you should always focus on writing maintainable code.
							<br>
							That means the code you write is readable, extensible, & testable.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Moving past tutorials</h2>
						<img src="img/real_world.jpg">
						<aside class="notes">
							In order to grow, you also need to start looking past tutorials.
							<br>
							Instead, check out source code for the libraries you use on GitHub.
							<br>
							Read RFC's as well.
							<br>
							Easier to understand than you think,
							and usually the most accurate documentation.

						<h1>Working Smart</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							Next up, let's talk about working smart.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="img/code_once.jpg">
						<aside class="notes">
							Everyone knows the saying, ‘Failing to plan is planning to fail’.
							<br>
							Spend time thinking about what you’re going to
							implement before writing code. Ex: if your creating an API, start with Docs.
							<br>
							Have an opinion... be able to explain why you made the choices you made!
							Nothing is more painful than seeing code that's been C&P'd and you know it because
							it's completely off.
							<br>
							Understand every single line of code you write.
							If it’s there, it needs to have a purpose,
							and you should be positive it’s doing what you think it’s doing.
							<br>
							Refrain from blindly copying and pasting!
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Practice makes permanent</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							Reflect then repeat.
							<br>
							Don't just strive to be a great developer, strive to be a great problem solver.
							<br>
							Languages, libraries, and frameworks are just tools. They come and go.
							What's popular today probably won’t be popular a decade from now.
							<br>
							You're going to need to be a lifelong learner.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>One thing at a time</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							Pick one thing and stick with it - ES6, Angular. I knew I wanted to do full stack
							JS, but also knew I wasn't going to learn half a dozen API's and
							a Web UI all at once.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Mental Awareness</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							Take care of yourself mentally and physically.
							I’ve been determined to stay in shape, & stay balanced.
							<br>
							Every day, wake up at 6, go to the gym, and for a run before work.
							I do sneak in podcasts sometimes. (Sshhh!)
							Only when I’m feeling up for it.
							<br>
							I’ve learned to go easy on the caffeine.
							Meditation has been valuable in order to stay grounded and focused.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Stop calling yourself dumb!</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							It’s a self fulfilling prophecy.
							Self talk is definitely the time to ‘fake it till you make it’!
							<br>
							As much as you want your job to only be about writing code, that’s not reality.
							<br>
							It can be an emotional career.
							Whether we (yes even guys) want to admit it or not,
							there are going to be highs and lows.
							<br>
							Also be aware of The Dunning-Kruger effect.
							<br>
							Says there's a tendency for under performers to overestimate their abilities
							<br>
							and for high performers to under estimate their abilities.

						<h2>When you don’t know how to do something,
							or you come across a tough bug remind yourself
						</h2>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">Every time something goes wrong in your program,
							you have an opportunity to learn something new!
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							A positive outlook is huge.
                            <br>
							Without it you can enter a pretty vicious cycle.
							<br>
							You work your butt off because you feel inadequate.
							<br>
							Then you start to feel burned out.
							<br>
							And that happens over and over.

						<p class="fragment fade-in">Hangouts</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							Started learning alone, and was grateful
							for the opportunity to learn with others instead,
							as part of a bootcamp.
							<br>
							Led me to start a private Slack channel at work for Jr's
							to ask questions.
							Manager watching probably didn’t even know till I gave this talk!
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="img/jr_study.jpg" style="width:600px;">
						<aside class="notes">
							Also led me to start a Jr Developer Meetup which is now a weekly Hangout.
							<br>
							There are large org's like Code Newbie that have a podcast, twitter chat and Slack group if you
							don't have something like this at work, or in your area.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Mentoring</h2>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">Developers who received mentoring were promoted
							<span class="emphasis">five</span> times more often than those who didn’t.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							* Now on mentoring,
							<br>
							Sun Microsystems studied the career progress of
							1,000 employees over a 5-year period and found ^^
							<br>
							You can even get mentorship in the form of code reviews by contributing to open source.
							<br>
							Or just stand back and try to soak up what you see seniors do.
							Ask if you can stay late and just peek over their shoulder.
							<br>
							Paring's awesome because Jr's are first learning
							how to create mental models
							<br>
							and it's another way to step back and absorb because remember, reflection is huge.
							Practice makes permanent.

						<p class="fragment fade-in">Imagine... you're adopting a dog</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							You can either go to the shelter and find an old one, or... you can get a puppy!
							<br>
							Sure, older dogs are usually already house trained, but they might also have some not so nice habits.
							<br>
							Puppies are notorious for chewing stuff up and making a mess, but given a nice environment with good training
							the investment can be really rewarding.
							<br>
							If getting a puppy sound fun, make sure you’re committed to the process, or they’ll just end up in the shelter!

							In other words, realize, you're also directly responsible for the success of a junior developer.

						<h2>Preparing yourself and the team</h2>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">Establishing a culture of communication</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Everyone should be sharing knowledge no matter what their job title is.
							<br>
							It builds trust and an environment where disagreements are healthy and
							ultimately highly constructive.
							<br>
							Keeping a positive attitude can empower people to work even harder than they might otherwise.
							<br>
							Ask us questions... some newbies find it intimidating to speak up.
							Check in often.
							You may need to watch for non-verbal queues.
							Ask directly, “Does this make sense”?

					<section>
						<h2>Preparing yourself and the team</h2>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">Frame conversations accordingly</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							You might need to explain things differently to a Jr than you would a senior developer.
							<br>
							A lot of the time we don’t have the same context to rely on as you do.
							<br>
							If you and I were watching the Olympics together and I told you 'a skater cheated their
							double axel and had a bad wrap’, you’d have no idea what I meant.
							<br>
							What I could say to you though is; 'they rotated their foot a quarter turn
							before taking off (cheating),
							<br>
							and their left leg came up above their knee in the air
							(wrapping) which is poor style’.
							<br>
							I might even get up and draw what that looks like… hint hint!
							<br>
							With the inverse approach:
							<br>
							You might be confused on what a double axel is, so you first Google that,
							<br>
							then you follow up by trying to figure out what the heck
							‘cheated’ and ‘wrap’ mean.. in that context,
							and before you know it, what could be explained smoothly,
							has turned into a 30 minute rabbit hole.
							<br>
							You might think this is a pain, but it will help you grow as you’ll
							have to think about a problem in a very different way.

						<h2>Preparing yourself and the team</h2>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">Good project management</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Jr's are still getting used to being able to gauge timing on projects.
							<br>
							Ambiguity can be tough to deal with.
							So, you need to set explicit expectations.
							<br>
							Managers and product managers should work together
							to ensure projects flow as smoothly.
							<br>
							You may want to provide additional details or constraints and
							break tasks down.
							Doing so will ultimately help a new developer progress faster.
						</aside>

						<aside class="notes">
							Saying goes, those who don’t think they need comments, are usually the worst offenders!
							<br>
							Developing a team style guide is great junior project and will make things go much smoothly
							during a code review.
							<br>
							JSCS makes this easier and can even also with documentation.
							<br>
							Without a doubt teams should be linting as well. Beyond the basics, there are things like
							Cyclomatic complexity: Number of different paths within a method or function. 5-10 = danger => refactor
							<br>
							This stuff is valuable to any code base.
							<br>
							With a junior, it means we learn best practices, and can help ourselves more.
							Avoiding unnecessary mistakes, and disruptions.
							(As with testing, this will also be at the top of a good Jr's list when evaluating
							companies they're interested in.

							Debug pair programming can be immensely valuable
							<br>
							Whether people admit or not, everyone writes bugs.

							arguably more difficult than writing your own program from scratch.
